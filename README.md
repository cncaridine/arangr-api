# Arangr: API

## Collaborators:
* Cori Caridine  
* Brendan Quirk

## Sites:
* [Arangr](https://arangr-front-end.herokuapp.com/)
* [Arangr Frontend GitHub](https://github.com/qui1217/arangr-front-end)

## Approach
Arangr was designed with a Rails backend and React frontend. The backend serves a JSON API with RESTful design using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The frontend consumes the Rails API. Both are deployed online via Heroku.

## Purpose
Arangr was designed to provide an alternative platform to promote upcoming events.

## Targeted Users
The site was created for people looking for local upcoming events.
